# RegexParserDemo
A demonstration for how a RegexParser can be used in natural language processing

The RegexParser demo is a small project intended to demonstrate how regular expressions can be used to tag linguistic feature data using identifiable patterns.  For example, a modal word, such as 'should,' 'would,' or 'could,' has a very definite pattern in that each word usually ends in 'ould.'  You can take advantage of this pattern to tag these words as 'modals' when tagging word tokens with part-of-speech tags or other feature tags.
